EV Adoption Forecasting
As EV adoption accelerates, urban planners must forecast future demand to ensure adequate infrastructure, especially charging stations. Poor planning can cause bottlenecks and hinder sustainability goals.

Problem Statement:
Use the EV dataset (vehicle registrations, types, and regional data) to build a model that predicts future EV adoption trends. For example, forecast the number of EVs in upcoming years.

Goal:
Develop a regression model to forecast EV adoption based on historical growth, vehicle types, and county-level data.
